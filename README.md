# Plant Based Trivia Game

Plant Based is a trivia game. You have a set amount of time to answer the question correctly; otherwise you'll have a few seconds to view the answer before it moves onto the next. In the end, you'll see your final score out of 10 questions.

This project was created as an assignment for the Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin.
