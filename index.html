			<p>Hi boys. I'm Tina. I've been using the toilet like an idiot. Dear God, this is Tina from school. This is where I thrash. Your body. Yeah it's an acquired taste. That I just acquired. Put it on a t-shirt, Jimmy Jr, I don't want to hear it.</p>

			<p>We can make this work. We can work out a dating wheel, just like a chore wheel. Let's put the try in triangle. Let's raise our glasses! I don't know. Eating lobster? It goes against everything we were taught to believe. Everyone touched each other's butts, and it was great. Crap attack? Don't have one? I'm torn. Dad raised me, but the shark gets me.</p>

			<p>If I drunk text you and you're asleep, don't text me in the morningâ€¦that ship has sailed. Your body. Sausage leather belts. Dr. Yap, once I was into you, but after seeing you torture my father, I think we should just be friends with dental benefits. I'm not spooked. What's the next thing after spooked? I'm that. My boob?</p>
